	<h1>Expressivism Through the Decades</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The term expressive is always painted as Romantic in nature. The ability to express the "self" has been held in high regard ever since the dawn of the industrial revolution.  Expression can come from the clothing you wear, the poetry you write, the music you make --- in a sense it is a direct representation of the self, projected into the public eye.  But how can this relate to writing in the classroom?  To be expressive in academic writing means that you must inevitably attach yourself to it, something that appears innate in the writing process.  Separation from the author and his or her work is nearly impossible given the influences that are put into writing.  In the mid-twentieth century, World War II was in full-swing.  American's involvement in the war was based partially on a lack of rhetorical communication.  This mindset created a huge shift in rhetoric and composition classrooms, establishing a rigid curriculum in which expression was frowned upon.  In the 1960s and 70s, rhetoricians and pedagogues including Donald Murray and Peter Elbow came together to try and form a solution to the strictness and limitations.  They formed a curriculum for the writing class that was based on writing as a process rather than a product, centering the class on the writer and voice rather than the teacher.  Their creation was expressivism. The history of expressivism is rather convoluted, and trying to define it in the context of the twenty-first century is even more so.  Although this form of process theory dominated the composition classroom, in the 1980s developers of a more critical, socially based theory, began to criticize it.  Expressivism was swiftly pushed to the side as a "primitive" and "Romanticized" teaching theory that had no academic benefits in the social context.  The critiques of Expressivism from classical and critical rhetoricians have created a narrow and falsified image of the overall theory, essentially "killing" it. However its death paved the way for vernacular practice that actually marries with other theories within the modern classroom, as seen in the concept of socio-expressivism. 
</p>

<h2>The Origins of Expressivism: 1960s-1970s</h2>
<p>
Arising from the conventions of rhetoric after World War II, current-traditional pedagogy was the predominate methodology of writing instruction until the Vietnam War.  Following the blames of poor rhetorical communication as the cause for World War II, the rhetoric was developed following a strict manner with a focus on error-correction and structure.  The structure was that of a "military industrial" complex, that undervalued the writer's role in the writing process and essentially assumed a "gate-keeping" role for universities as well as careers (Burnham, 22).  This rigid structure based itself off of an objective curriculum - all sharing similar skills, exercises, and objectives.  The current-traditional classroom did "not concern themselves, at least on any large scale, with voice, passivity, imaginative thinking, or breaking away from conformity" (Gradin, 22).  In this respect it did not advocate a generative discourse, rather it was mechanical.  Lad Tobin describes this sort of classroom in his article "Process Pedagogy," where he mentions that, "...almost all papers were five-paragraph essays" and how all of the students were "writing the night before it [the essay] was due" (1).  This style described by Tobin is the standard five-paragraph, three-pronged thesis that is often encountered in high school classrooms.  Tobin also goes on to say that they never participated in free-writing, collaboration, peer review, or even general workshopping.  Everything was based on the product, and not the process.
</p>

<p>
The lack of concern for the writer and voice in the curriculum of current-traditional pedagogy gained some opposition starting in the 1960s going into the 1970s.  Just as the Romantics, like Wordsworth and Thoreau, rose to counter the conforming conventions of the industrial revolution, rhetoricians began to raise their voices against the mechanical conventions of the product-based current-traditional pedagogy.  In his book Writing Without Teachers, Peter Elbow critiqued current-traditional theory, saying that it sabotages the overall ability to write because it is "writing backwards", it is "not organic".1  To Elbow, writing is growing a message and not necessarily knowing a message.  He writes, "The commonest criticism directed at the process of writing is that you didn't clarify your thinking ahead of time; allowed yourself to wander; you didn't make an outline," all of which expresses the idea that "good style, the primary rule and condition is, not to attempt to express ourselves in language before we thoroughly know our meaning..." (14). Although Elbow does actually commend the editing aspects of the current-traditional model, his commendation is negated by his reaction to the lack of self and voice inherent in the pedagogy.  Elbow believed that current-traditional was doing nothing but indoctrinating students into a single, structured model of writing in which the product, not the process, was "in control".  His solution, as well as that of many others such as Donald Murray, was expressivism.
</p>

<p>
If current-traditional pedagogy was theory based on product, then it was obvious that a offset to it would be based on process. Out of this idea came four different process-based theories: expressive, cognitive, social, and marxist (Tobin 10).  Expressivism, though based on process, differed from the other theories in that it rooted itself in Romantic traits and values. Christopher Burnham defines expressivism in his article "Expressivist Pedagogy" as theory that:
</p>

<blockquote>
...places the writer in the center, articulates its theory, and develops its pedagogical system by assigning the highest value to the writer and her imaginative, psychological, social, and spiritual development and how the development influences individual consciousness and social behavior.  Expressivst pedagogy employs freewriting, journal keeping, reflective writing, and small-group dialogic response to foster a writer's aesthetic, cognitive, and moral development. (19)
</blockquote>

<p>
Burnham explains that expressivism values the writer in the center of the classroom, as well as his or her moral and spiritual development.  Moral and spiritual growth of the individual are key assets akin to those of transcendental ideals found in eighteenth and nineteenth century Romanticism, which had a focus on self-transcendence in the form of internal and personal truth.  Looking back even further, we could even say that expressivism's roots are not merely based in the nineteenth century, but in the fifth century BC as well, in which the philosophy of Plato blossomed.  Both expressivism's and Romanticism's Platonic roots stem from Plato's philosophy in which truth in the material world is unreliable because it is always in flux, thus the most reliable truth is that of the "self" attained from "internal apprehension."
</p>

<p>
While expressivism does undeniably borrow characteristics of Romanticism, often dubbing it the title of "new Romanticism," there were additional sources that contributed to its growth into an actual theory.  Prior to the existence of expressivism as a known pedagogical movement, James Britton explored the process of language acquisition in children.  In brief, his research involved studying the process of language learning with a focus on what is called the "expressive function" (Burnham, 26).  Expressive function, in the context of linguistics, focuses on the expression of emotional states and personal feelings rather than aspects of the material world.  It is something that Britton says, "...provides means for individuals to connect abstract concepts with personal experiences and negotiate boundaries between public and private significance" (26).  It was in this crossing of boundaries that Britton argues there is a creation that results in "concrete understanding and learning" (26).  What was meant to be a linguistic discovery quickly shifted into writing, which is not surprising considering the strong correlation of both language and composition.  Following Britton, pedagogues like Murray and Elbow based their approach in the teaching of writing from the ideas of expressive function and its successes.
</p>

<p>
In the early 1960s, Peter Elbow, one of expressivism's most notable theorists, and Donald Murray, began to preach how voice and the discovery of the self within voice are necessary to have effective rhetorical communication.  In their mixture of Romantic values and expressive function, they believed that having personal voice led to a discovery through the writing process in which one could essentially both write to learn and learn to write.  After dealing with his current-traditional style classroom in his own experience, Lad Tobin became inspired by Murray, who advocated something entirely different from anything he had read before:

<blockquote>
"What is the process we should teach?  It is the process of discovery through language.  It is the process of exploration of what we know and what we feel about what we know through language ... instead of teaching finished writing we should teach unfinished writing, and glory in its unfinishedness... This is not a question of correct or incorrect, of etiquette or custom.  This is a matter of far higher importance.  The writer, as he writes, is making ethical decisions.  He doesn't test his words by a rule book, but by life.  He used language to reveal the truth to himself so that he can tell it to others.  It is an exciting, eventful, evolving process." (Learning by Teaching 15)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Murray advocates the use of a personal truth, one that can eventually be expressed into a social truth through the actual process of writing itself.  In his ideology writing is a generative process that leads to discovery, not a finished product in which personal characteristics are removed.  This is a complete shift from the current-traditional.  In 1972 Murray wrote an article called "Teach Writing as Process Not Product," in which Murray says that, as English teachers, it is only natural when grading papers that we view the written products of our students as literature, "with which we dissect and sometimes almost destroy Shakespeare or Robert Lowell to prove it" (1).  His point in this is that what the students turn in is, in fact, not literature.  He explains that  the students often know it is not literature, and that often, dissecting their final products for every single small mistake is only making their confidence and thus their writing skills worsen.  He advocates the ideas that "students are individuals who must explore the writing process in their own way" and that "there are no rules, no absolutes, just alternatives... Writing is experimental" (6). This is where the idea of process theory enters, erasing the seemingly natural need to analyze student papers as literature in the realization that writing serves as both a verb and a noun.  While it can refer to a product, it is also a process in action, where a student's voice can develop and grow.
</p>

<p>
In 1973 Peter Elbow published his book Writing Without Teaching, a book which many argue changed the face of composition.  Like Murray and his writings, Elbow explains the necessities of personal and expressive writing in the classroom. When Elbow began to teach he quickly realized that he did not care for the "flaws" found in his student's papers.  "These things could be called flaws, yet the more I think about it, the more it seemed these professional, objective matters of diction, paragraphing, organization, and argument weren't what determined how I responded to a paper" (Writing Without 119).  Elbow describes his trouble with trying to grade in a subjective manner on objective content.  He respected content over style and developed a classroom with multiple readers and a respectable amount of group work to function as their own practitioners in the process of writing.  Elbow, in his love of metaphors, calls the writing process "cooking," in which groups form an interaction of contrasting and conflicting material which helps to transform and develop ideas.  This development of ideas through "cooking" is what Elbow considers growing.
</p>

<p>
Elbow's metaphors of "cooking" and "growing"  stem from his belief that writing is an organic process.  Because of its organic nature, free-writing is something he puts strong emphasis on.  In Writing Without Teachers he describes that one of his daily assignments as a ten minute long free-writing assignment where the students do not stop writing, regardless if they have ideas or not.  Submitting these often humorous assignments to Elbow himself was optional. What Elbow wanted the students to learn from this was how to avoid writer's block.  Elbow points out that, while editing is not the problem in writing (in fact it is necessary), students still get stuck in the editing process while trying to simultaneously produce.  He argues that "Writing can be edited but that is its downfall because schooling makes us obsessed with mistakes" (5).  Elbow might as well have been calling out current-traditional pedagogy in that statement.  Throughout the book, he declares that students are so engrossed in structure and conventions that their process, voice, and content are often sacrificed.  He argues that free-writing is similar to speech in that it is "non-editing" and thus when practiced "undoes the ingrained habit of editing at the same time you are trying to produce" (6).
</p>

<p>
In escaping the habit of editing, a student is able to discover their voice, which, to Elbow, is the key and point of everything he teaches.  In a touching prose he states, "Your voice is the only voice you have... If you abandon your voice you will most likely never be heard" (7).  To Elbow, personal voice is not only important in expressing emotion in writing, but also in that it puts the self into the writing, creating powerful rhetoric in an emotional truth that can be shared and constructively critiqued by others in peer review.  While Elbow admits that free-writing is a process of "chaos" that initially creates "garbage," he also says that once that "garbage" is refined, it creates a distinctive voice that is not chaotic, but is coherent with power and meaning.  It was within this ideology, as well as that of Murray's – an ideology which advocated a truth established through the individual -- that expressivism was born.

</p>

<h2>The War with Expressivism: 1970s-1980s</h2>

<p>
In Writing Without Teachers, Elbow points out that "The most frequent result of cooking and growing, however, is that they are mistaken for disasters and stamped out" (70).  Unfortunately, his observation was correct.  In the late 1970s continuing through the 1980s, expressivism as a theory came under attack from the rising social-constructionist rhetoricians.  Social-constructionism, sometimes called social-epistemic, was based on "the view that good writers must master the accepted practices of a discourse community" and was generally accepted as an alternative to expressivism (Fishman and McCarthy 647).  From its ideology alone, it is easy to see why those who fall into socio-epistemic rhetoric would dislike expressivism, because expressivism did anything but master "accepted practices" of communities.  Expressivism became associated with terms like "primitive" and "Romantic,".  While being associated with Romanticism is not necessarily a bad thing, James Berlin, a rhetorician who often favored himself as a social-epistemic, and others like him, believed the term carried a negative connotation in relation to writing.  People deemed Romantic were considered "idealistic nature freaks" who remain ignorant of "history, society, and human nature" (Gradin 7).  They were hopeless Romantics who, lost in their own emotions, expressed themselves in a senseless stream of consciousness.  We currently live in a culture that places great significance on logic, reason, and scientific facts; in this respect, expressivism's Romantic values that lie in intuitive imagination appear silly and illogical.
</p>

<p>
In his article Contemporary Composition, Berlin describes the different types of rhetoric present in the twentieth century.  Calling expressivism Neo-platonic, Berlin describes it as a theory in which truth "is only attainable through internal apprehension" (774).  While Elbow would argue that internal apprehension is a good thing, Berlin says otherwise, saying that the truth attained from this form of apprehension is a truth that "is conceived as the result of a private vision" a vision that does not take part is discourse community and thus separates itself from society (774).  To Berlin, the Platonic roots of expressivism are its downfall, saying that although "ultimate truth can be discovered by the individual" it "cannot be communicated" (773-774).  If truth can be discovered, but not communicated, there is essentially no point in truth.  Communication is key to socio-constructivism in creating a body of knowledge that everyone borrows from and contributes to.  If knowledge is socially constructed, then it cannot exist in something that cannot communicate socially.  Similarly, individuals may be empowered by this truth, but with a lack of social connections, there is little point in empowerment.
</p>

<p>
Continuing the critiques of social isolation, Berlin did not just attack expressivism's platonic roots – he took a jab at its Romantic roots as well.  In her book Romancing Rhetorics Sherrie Gradin argues that Berlin was "single-handedly responsible for concrete divisions between expressivist rhetorics..." (2). Ironically, Berlin displayed a liking of Romantic rhetoric in the nineteenth century, a liking that changed drastically in his description of expressivism in the twentieth century. Gradin argues that because of the "power struggles" seen within English, literary-theories were held in high-regard, leaving little room for subjective Romantic ideals.  This could be true, but I don't think Berlin was completely against subjectivity in his distaste for expressivism.  Rather I think he was absolute in his belief of writing in a social and critical realm. Berlin argues that "... knowledge is socially constructed, and thus gender, class, and race matter" (Gradin 3).  To Berlin, the term social and expressivism obviously did not coincide, and because of this it made it an inferior theory.  In order to have the knowledge to make an argument, Berlin believes that the writer must be socially, not personally, aware. Expressivism does not make the writer focus on their ideological situation.  In its overall focus on personal voice, expressivism was deemed selfish and individualized; something that cuts the writer completely off from society. Berlin describes personal writing, a style deeply embedded in expressivist theory, as something that represents "the solitary self acting alone." In this he is "envision[ing] an expressivist subject who refuses to participate in the social world" (Gradin 146).  The Romantic image Berlin compares expressivism to is the lone Thoreau, writing his thoughts of Walden and isolated in his cabin. 
</p>

<p>
A criticism closely tied to that of the socially avoidant expressivist writer was that of the lack of authority in the expressivist teacher.  Given the subjectivity of the theory, many social-constructivists argued that it was impossible to grade such personal essays and therefore difficult for teachers to maintain authority in their grading methods.  Not only is it difficult to grade, but it is also difficult, if not impossible, to teach.  Berlin argues that something involving a "private act of institution," like expressivism, cannot truly be taught because one cannot "instruct students in the principles of writing" (Gradin 10).  Considering Elbow's title Writing Without Teachers, it is easy to see where Berlin gets his claim.  It does not seem very feasible to teach a personal subject, even Elbow himself asks the teacher to step down from the podium and start working through their own work with the students, saying that the students can function without the teacher, but the teacher cannot function without the students (Elbow ix).  In this respect Berlin argues that there is no concern with the overall audience of the writer.  In a rather harsh statement he says that expressivists are "denying the communal nature of art and therefore abolish rhetoric's reason for being" (Berlin 771).  In order to use effective rhetorical devices and skills, there needs to be an audience to work with, but the lack of community and teacher-figure in expressivist pedagogy makes it difficult, erasing any need for communication and rhetoric in general, two massive aspects of writing.</p>

  <p>Yet another common critique of expressivim in the 80's was that expressivist theory established the Romantic myth that good writers are either born or inspired, but they cannot be not made.  In Romancing Rhetorics Gradin mentions Coleridge's Kubla Khan as an example of this myth.  In the prelude to the poem Coleridge explains his creative process as coming without effort in a matter of moments (Gradin 8). Coleridge's writing arose from inspiration (and also drug use).  He explains that his writing was a gift from a muse, something that can never be repeated.  In essence, he is saying that his writing genius arose from poetic inspiration and nothing more.  Cognitive rhetorician Linda Flowers uses Coleridge as a prime Romantic example, arguing that this myth is also found within the Romantic conventions of expressivism. To her, the idea of inspiration "breeds passivity" in students, making them believe that they must wait for inspiration to occur if they are to write well rather than work hard and practice (Gradin 8-9).  In addition, this leads students to fall into the idea that writers are born and not made; an idea that contributes to a further lack of confidence in student writing and "kill[s] the motivation of students who have struggled with mastery of technique" (Gradin 9). </p>

  <p>One of the final major criticisms of expessivism is focused on its overall limitations as an academic theory.  To many of its critics, expressivism was viewed as something that was only used for self-expression – something with no place inside the classroom.  David Bartholomae says that it makes students "suckers" and "powerless" in the world of composition (Fishman and McCarthy 648).  To many other critics, Bartholomae was correct, arguing that the lack of academic discourse present in expressivist practice was a disservice to students, making them incompetent in the classroom.  While it taught students self-expression, it did not prepare them for the future.  Furthermore, Berlin mentions that writing should be "solely communication of the truth,"  and, as the truth of expressivism is internal and false, making it usless (771).  Like Bartholomae, Berlin says that expressivism comes at the price of "intellectual rigor," contributing to its overall inferiority in the realm of composition (Gradin 5).  To him, it seems that nothing academic can arise out of the pedagogy.  Berlin also says that Peter Elbow "... is after all, the only individual acting alone apart from others, who can determine the existent, the good, the possible" to arise out of expressivist composition (Fishman and McCarthy 648).  Essentially, Berlin believes that Peter Elbow is the only evidence that Expressivism is successful at all.</p>

  <p>Another figure in the social-epistemic realm who makes a similar argument, Patricia Bizzell, states that writing in expressivism is based on "debased Romantic creativity" in which writing can "be produced as easily as a hen laying an egg" (Fishman and McCarthy 648).  The lack of structural rigor and audience within expressivism puts the students in a situation where they can produce work easily.  This creates problems because without a challenge, the students will not improve in their writing skills.  Steven Fishman, author of "Is Expressivism Dead", says that Bizzell also argues that:
</p>

<blockquote>
...by failing to teach academic language, expressivism harms students in two ways.  One, [that] encouraging students to write in everyday language puts them at a disadvantage when they must write within academic disciplines.  Two, [that] since mastering academic discourse... is also learning new ways of thinking, expressivists limit students' chances to develop academically valued ways of thinking (Fishman McCarthy 649)
</blockquote>

<p>According to Bizzell, students in an expressivist classroom will not be able to develop a formal academic prose.  They will also not be able to learn any cognitive methods in composition, as many of those methods are based on rhetoric and the consideration of an audience.  In all of these criticisms, it is apparent that expressivism has little to no academic value.</p>

<h2>Rethinking the Critique: 1990s</h2>

<p>
At the very core of all criticisms of expressivism is the view of expressivists as naive and isolated individuals who fail to fall into academic standards.  After all of these critiques, expressivism seemed to slowly die off, making room for social constructive and critical pedagogies, which were considered to be socially, culturally, and politically involved, creating a theory and practice that empowered students both culturally and academically.  However, in the 1990s a few pedagogues came to the defense of expressivism.  Even Peter Elbow returned to refute what he considered to be narrow-minded claims.  In fact, these defenses were not just in writing, but also in popular culture and media.  As Sherrie Gradin points out in Romance Rhetorics, the film Dead Poets Society (1989), juxtaposes the expressivist-like teacher Mr. Keating with a very traditional boarding school.  In short, Mr. Keating awakens his students to a better understand and enjoyment of literature, displaying the confining effects of more formulaic pedagogies. These arguments in the defense of expessivism focused on the idea that the critiques in the 80s were short-sighted.  Looking back at the Romantic roots, they argue that Romanticism was not merely for the isolated individual, but that it actually establishes a communal connection, something that is an important rhetorical device in itself.
</p>
<p>
In defense of expressivism's Romantic origins, Stephen Fishman and Lucille McCarthy co-wrote the article "Is Expressivism Dead?," which delves into the philosophy of Romanticism in order to better understand the overall movement.  This is important because it "broaden[s] our understanding of Romanticism..." in doing so "we find unity through diversity, we improve our chances of assessing Elbow's work fairly" (649).   They both argue that Romanticism, in actuality, had a goal of finding common ground among communities and individuals alike, not actually isolating individuals from communities.  Romanticism focused on resisting the conforming and mechanical objectifications of nature and man's relationship with it.  Although the idea of the "social contract"2 helped to establish institutions and careers in an ever-growing industrialized nation, it placed limiting ideas on human nature.  There was a lack of common purpose because life was already destined.  Work was done to secure money and safety and education was simply a step towards getting a career. In order to fight these conventions, writers of the period were often put into an isolated position, which is the reason it is so criticized today.  In this respect "To understand Romanticism as championing the artists as a lonely, spontaneous genius is to adopt too narrow a view of Romanticism" (Fishman and McCarthy 649-650). 
</p>
<p>
Fishman and McCarthy were not the only ones to consider the critiques of Berlin and others to be narrow-minded.  In Romancing Rhetorics, Gradin rises to the defense of it as well.  She believes that critics who think expressivism stems from Romantic roots "ignore the fact that Romantics used both the self and social self in their theories" and instead "focus on the conventions of isolation in their tie to nature" (xv). In this, she argues that expressivism is the antithesis of isolating, rather it is a theory that advocates the use of the self in society where the writer creates a unique perspective that, ultimately, contributes to society.  She also argues that "the subject of Romanticism [the self] is not a single definable entity... it is not merely for the individual as Berlin wants to argue" it is actually "defined through connections" (Gradin17).  The self is actually a social entity, one that, as Berlin claimed, is socially constructed. Because of this, it is impossible for the self to separate itself from society or general social conventions. 
</p>
<p>
Gradin furthers her defense in a direct attack on the idea of the "myth" of the inspired writer and Coleridge.  She says that it is absurd to pull such a claim from a single, opium using, example (95).  In that respect is resembles Berlin's claim that Elbow is the only successful product of expressivism.  Gradin goes on to say that inspiration in composition is actually a good thing because it stems from the imagination and can be structured and cultivated (96).  In practice, inspiration becomes a habit, not some rare occurrence from a muse.  Cultivating inspiration through practicing the writing process can actually lead to a level of academic intellect.  She argues that "writing and thinking are not separate entities... exercising emotive, analytical processes, driving towards synthesis, writing for discovery, and demanding reflexivity – all components of an expressivist based classroom – are intellectually demanding" (Gradin 93). Adding the self to the writing process in a personal aspect does not make it any less academic, because writing and thinking are directly linked – all writing demands a strong process and flow of thought and thus improves rhetorical skills.  This defense of the Romantic aspects of expressivism asks teachers and students to reconsider what nineteenth century Romanticism truly was like – not as isolating or primitive, but something in which a community and an individual have a mutual relationship.


</p>

<p>As expressivism came under attack, so did one of its most prolific theorist, Peter Elbow.</p>

<p>In Writing Without Teachers Elbow states, "the reason to write is to connect with others.... to get into the heads of other people" (73).  Berlin would argue that expressivism does just the opposite.   Steve Fishman argues otherwise.  In "Is Expressivism Dead" he explains that critics who view Elbow as a naïve Romantic way and connect him to the image of the isolated writer "have done a disservice to him by ignoring important aspects of Romanticism" (653).  He makes the claim that Elbow is similar to the Romantic German philosopher Johann Herder in that both writing, in an expressive sense, can lead to a personal and public body of knowledge.  Where Elbow believes that writing must occur before it can have a direct path, Herder believes that "human expression is both an embodiment and clarification" (Fishman and McCarthy 650).  Just as writing leads to ideas and a clear path, emotions lead to clarity in thought.  Because writing and emotion can lead to a clarification, the personal aspects of expressivism are not selfish in nature, but social in that it leads to self-discovery for a means of social-connection.  The criticisms were right in respect to that, in isolation, one cannot learn.  However, Fishman and Gradin both point out that expressivist theory was anything but isolating.  In order to understand ourselves in the first place, there needs to be contrast, a relationship outside of the self.
</p>

<p>
In 2012, Peter Elbow wrote an article entitled "Exploring Problems With the Two Key Terms, Personal Writing and Expressivism." In this manuscript, Elbow defends expressivism in a rather unique stance, saying that expressivism was never truly what the theory was called, rather it was a name given to it by Berlin and others who have critiqued it.  He states that "the characterization of expressivism was harmful for the field.  Expressivism is a seriously misleading word.  It had led to countless people's skewed and oversimplified assumptions about a period and group of people.  I'd say that we [Murray, Britton, and himself] all defended and even celebrated personal writing in a school context where it had been neglected of even banned" ("Exploring Problems" 23).  It is evident that Elbow dislikes the terminology used to define and historicize a theory he holds so close, particularly in his high esteem for personal writing.  Elbow refutes the argument that personal writing cut offs the writer from society, bringing up that fact that personal writing goes hand in hand with nonpersonal writing ( 5).  Looking at fields like journalism, he argues that it is impossible to not put the self in an argument.  If the writer becomes separated from his or her work, the work then becomes "dishonest." In this respect, writers have a "duty in remaining honest by revealing their personal-stake" (14).  In addition, the readers cannot truly comprehend the credibility of an argument "unless they know something about the writer" (14).  He then expresses his annoyance with academics who try and portray themselves as being disinterested in whatever it is they are writing about, questioning "Why the conventions of academic discourse still reflect a pretense of objectivity, when academics themselves are so busy saying that objectivity is impossible?" (15). Elbow continues with this argument, saying that "personal modes of writing help writers take more authority over their writing" to the point where they cease to fall into "tangled, un-invested prose" (21). In essence, person writing adds an emotional touch to rhetoric, which gives writing a deeper meaning.  Towards the end of his prose, Elbow shifts to a different tone.  Rather than a defensive stance he transitions into a fearful disposition, expressing that he "is afraid that expressivism is hopelessly infected by narrow and usually pejorative connotations" (24).

<h2>What is...Socio-expressivism? Late 1990's +</h2>

<p>
In the late 1990s, a new version of expressivism emerged in order to oppose the harsh and on-going critiques from social constructivists.  This new pedagogy was called socio-expressivism.  In Romancing Rhetorics, Gradin not only defends expressivism, but advocates its potential in socio-expressivism.  She points out that expressivism had its faults, one of them being that students often fall into a subjective ideal of how they think and feel, and believe they are in the "right" compared to others.  However, because expressivist theory is often defined by open connections with culture and self, it is very easy for it to marry or merge with other socially inclined theories (102).  Essentially what socio-expressivism does is take social issues and occurrences and relates them back to the self3.  This forms a rhetorical theory that remains concerned with students as being "whole beings" (114).  If people in a system must negotiate in that system, then they both act and are acted upon in their environment whether they want to or not.  Socio-expressivism allows for the student "to be effective citizens and rhetorical beings" through "leaning how to carry a negotiation with the self and the world" (101).  In essence, a construction of the self is important in confronting and understanding other beliefs within a culture.  With this in mind, the socio-expressivist classroom calls for reflective writing on cultural topics and attempts to remain as multi-cultural as possible, it is understood that the self is part of culture, and that culture would not exist without the self.  This idea of "self-expression" in a cultural context, allows students to gain awareness of their own ideas and opinions, their own voice, which is something that allows them to better understand the world around them and also be a part of it.</p>

Fishman and McCarthy also explain socio-expressivism.  They argue that the primary goal of expressivism, to have a student grow and understand their own experiences and writing process, can actually achieve the same goals as social constructivism. Their primary example is Fishman's philosophy class.  Fishman realized that his students did not learn well unless they had an emotional connection with what they were doing, so he had the idea of relating what the students learned to their own lives.  In an interview with McCarthy, he states:
</p>

<blockquote>
...and I feel like I am being pulled in two directions, my professors from graduate school whispering in one ear, ‘Initiate ‘em into philosophy with a capital P, with close critical analysis of canonic texts.'  In my other ear is sounding my own conviction based on twenty-five years of teaching: students don't learn very well unless they have emotional connection.  If they cannot relate their own lives to philosophy, their familiar languages to the new one, the papers they write will be no more than products of a mind game. They won't be their own, and they won't help them live their lives. (654)
</blockquote>

<p>In his class, Fishman's overall goal is to have the students directly connect their personal lives to philosophy, something he believes will make the learning of it all the more empowering.  In his classroom, he set the desks in in circles, and at the beginning of each class he would ask the students to free-write for ten minutes.  The writing is often in response to questions like "what does it mean to fail?" or "how do we come to know something?" and often times results in heavy group discussion once the writing is complete (655).  His students seem to find much success in this method, saying that they feel that they are "contributing to a center." They say it is impossible not to be involved with others, and that as their writing progresses, it often begins to display a sense of self in relation to others (655-657). At the very heart of socio-expressivism is the marriage of two warring pedagogical theories, ultimately creating a pedagogy that establishes a sense of citizenship within a culture of unique individuals, all of whom have a voice of their own to contribute.</p>

<h2>Classroom Vernacular and Conclusion</h2>

 
<p>
Expressivism's history as a pedagogy is a roller coaster of ups and downs.  Rising to meet the strict and rigid standards of current-traditional, its innovative structure based on Romantic values and Platonism grew in popularity.  Figures like Donald Murray and Peter Elbow enthusiastically supported a generative form of writing --- viewing writing as a process rather than simply product.  Their theories had a strong focus on personal and reflective writing in order to find the self in relation to society.  Suddenly the theory itself came under attack, with its Romantic roots as a target.  Social constructivists like James Berlin said the theory focuses solely on the individual, that it had no place in academic discourse, and that it made students believe that writing is an innate skill.  Following those criticisms came claims that the critiques were narrow-minded, these claims argued that Berlin and his followers needed to reassess their view of Romanticism as a whole.  Gradin, Fishman, McCarthy, and even Elbow himself point out that the goal of Romanticism was never meant to put a person in isolation in a selfish pursuit of self-discovery, but rather to help the writer find a voice in order to be a part of society.  Between the confusing history of critiques and then critiques of the critiques, expressivism ironically ended up being the perfect match for the very thing that detested it, social constructivism.
</p>
<p>
In all of this, I want to conclude with the argument that it is important to understand the complex history of expressivism as a theory, because it is in this history that we can find out where and exactly what it has become today.  Following the initial publications on socio-expressivism in the 1990s, little work has been published about socio-expressivism.  I find this saddening that the most recent source I found was a manuscript written in 2012 by a retiring Peter Elbow, like a knight in his final stance of defense.  So why is so little published now?  Perhaps it is because when expressivism evolved and merged with social traits it simply became the vernacular in modern composition curriculum.  It provides survival tactics by attaching the self to both writing and culture. As teachers, we all want our students to succeed and consider themselves to be a part of society, but we also want them to realize that they have a unique verse to contribute to society as well.  We want them to realize that writing is a form of empowerment in which one can publically place the self within a culture. Although we may not realize it, socio-expressivism seems to sneak its way into the classroom in writing assignments that involve not only free-writing but also reflection, inquiry, and analysis.   Perhaps the term expressionism slowly slipped away because of the pedagogical binaries and hierarchies that it was forced in with.  Perhaps it is because it has been covered in on-going criticisms and common misconceptions, but regardless of how the term disappeared, what is important now is how the theory is reclaimed.
