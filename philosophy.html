<p>English, and the study of it, has profoundly changed my life. It embodies humanity, emotion, psychology, history, life, reading, writing, music, communication, rhetoric, linguistics, culture, and more. I am an English major because I am fascinated by humanity, life, and love, by how people think and feel, what makes them feel that way, and how they express themselves.  I find it absolutely enthralling that so much can be found in a single subject- English is seemingly limitless in its subjective nature.  It is in the nature of English's subjectivity to teach skills used both inside and outside of the classroom, creating an open-mindedness in the students that questions, analyzes, and critically examines both the student themselves and the world around them.</p>
<p>Currently, my literature classes teach literary analysis and cultural understanding through writing assignments based on the class reading. Within these methods, my students learn the process of inquiry and analysis in a multitude of settings.  They also learn how to defend their own arguments and viewpoints in discussion groups and writing.  I also create a collaborative classroom setting in which my students learn to both criticize and build-off of each other's view in addition to doing their own doing peer-review and group work.  The in-class writing assignments help my students advance their rhetorical development, something that will aid in the building of their longer projects or assignments. Writing, to me, is a very valuable tool in any field a student plans to enter.  In this I plan to teach that what the students write and learn in English, which is so often thought of as irrelevant, is undeniably relevant to their lives.  Writing can be used to for communication and learning.  It can teach us about self-discovery, how to find our voice, and also about rhetorical skills and arguments.  Writing and learning go hand in hand, and with my composition class I plan to take both a "learning to write" and "writing to learn" approach in which the assignments develop from one-another.</p>
<p>Although I am still relatively new to the world of teaching, I have learned that being myself and being open to what experiences bring me are key assets to the discovery of my own philosophy.  I plan to put emphasis on experimenting with new theories and heuristics in order to develop myself within the field of education.  Adaptability to the constant flux of changes, curriculum, students, environments, and tasks is the best way to begin my journey -- especially in the modern classroom.  To me, this adaptability involves the use of digital literacy in the classroom, a term that expands into both transliteracy and literacy itself.  A focus on digital literacy allows the students to realize the capability for what they learn as well as its capacity to exit the classroom; they learn that the term literacy, literature, or text can be applied to things outside of textbooks.  In regards to transliteracy, students will learn to read, write, and communicate over a number of different platforms, creating important skills that will stay with them in their future careers.</p>
