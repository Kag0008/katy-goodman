<p>English, and the study of it, has profoundly changed my life.  To me it embodies humanity, emotion, psychology, history, life, reading, writing, music, communication, rhetoric, linguistics, culture, and more. I am an English major because I am fascinated by humanity, life, and love, by how people think and feel, what makes them feel that way, and how they express themselves.  I find it absolutely enthralling that so much can be found in a single subject- it is seemingly limitless in its subjective nature.  And it is in the very nature of English's subjectivity to teach skills that are used both inside and outside of the classroom, creating an open-mindedness in the students that questions, analyzes, and critically examines both themselves and their relationship the world around them.  I use the flexibility and relevance of English as a learning tool for my students and I encourage the idea of transfer in the classroom, where both writing, inquiry, analysis, rhetoric, and communication can be seen as tools that can be utilized in not only the classroom, but also my student's daily lives.</p>

<p>At Auburn University I am currently in my first semester of teaching discussion sections of World Literature.  Through this experience, I have learned to work within the limitations of a class that has already be structured, and have also learned how to develop writing assignments around the context of literary analysis.  One thing I have realized in teaching this class is that the majority of my students, who have taken and passed the freshman composition courses, still feel extremely vulnerable in the field of writing.  They often lack confidence and ultimately do not consider themselves to be writers.  It is my goal through teaching to make them realize that they are all writer's.  That holding a pen in their hands or typing on a keyboard establishes them as creators of a piece of writing and that each "writer" has a unique contribution to the field, regardless of what it is.</p> 

<p>I firmly believe the reason so many students lose confidence in their ability to write is because they are trapped in the convention that "good writing" equals "good grammar," and in this they lose their voice and thought process in attempt to edit as they write.  To me, "good writing" surpasses the traditional requirement of grammatical structure.  While grammar is indeed essential in both rhetorical and structural contexts it can also serve as a catalyst for writer's block.  I teach writing as an organic and generative process, which I believe is something that allows the student to realize how their thoughts develop and mature as they write.  Writing is not just about a finished product, it is about the process of getting to that product -- it is about how you grow and what you learn as your writing progresses.  I want my students to develop engaging, strong, and passionate voices that will ultimately lead them to view writing as a form of empowerment.  A form in which one can publically place the self within a culture of other unique individuals through expression.</p>

<p>Although I am still relatively new to the world of teaching, I have learned that being myself and being open to what experiences bring me are key assets to the discovery and development of my own philosophy.  I plan to put emphasis on experimenting with new theories and heuristics in order to develop myself within the field of education.  Adaptability to the constant flux of changes, curriculum, students, environments, and tasks is the best way to begin my journey especially in a field the modern classroom.  To me, this adaptability involves the use of digital literacy in the classroom, a term that expands into both transliteracy and literacy itself.  A focus on digital literacy allows the students to realize the capability for what they learn as well as its capacity to exit the classroom; they learn that the term literacy, literature, or text can be applied to things outside of textbooks.  In regards to transliteracy, students will learn to add inquiry and analysis to their daily lives.  From my time as both a student and a teacher, I learned that the most effective tool of learning is found in enthusiasm, passion, and relevance.  While staying in the guidelines of core curriculum, I allow my students flexibility in their writing so they can relate themselves to it and therefore write with a purpose.</p>
