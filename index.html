<p>I am currently a first year MA student and graduate teaching assistant at Auburn University studying Rhetoric and Composition.  This portfolio is a reflection of my own teaching methodologies and will probably change over the next few years as I gain more experience in the field of writing and education.  Many of my interests revolve around the idea of transfer skills and process theory in the classroom. However, I am also interested in linguistics, interactive media, and environmental studies and conservation.  The most important thing for me as a teacher is that my students view what they are doing in the classroom as something that is relevant to their overall lives, something that allows them to use analysis and inquiry to see things in a new light, and most importantly, helps them to grow.</p>
