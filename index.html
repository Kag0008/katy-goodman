<h4>Hello!</h4>
<p>I'm Katy Goodman. Currently I am a first year Master's student, professional coffee drinker, creative idealist, writer, and teacher. I am working on my MA in Rhetoric and Composition with a concentration in Communication. This portfolio is a snippet of my own writing and teaching methodologies;
it will change over the next few years as I gain more experience in the field of writing and education. 
Many of my interests revolve around the idea of writing and digital media; however, I am also interested in linguistics, interactive media, cognitive science, and sustainability. 

When I am not busy writing, researching, or working on freelance editing projects I am often found outdoors horseback riding, reading, or coaching and playing soccer. Sometimes I can be found inside playing video games or baking. I also love being active in my community and often volunteer wherever and whenever I have the opportunity. My own definition of success, as wisely defined by Emerson, is to make a difference in the lives of others.

As a teacher, the most important thing is that my students view what they are doing in the classroom
as something that is relevant to their overall lives. My goal as a writing teacher is to teach something that allows them to use analysis and inquiry in a real world context. Writing, as a process, has the ability to provoke and develop thoughts and ideas. It is through this growth that I truly believe students can find successful transfer skills that they can carry into all aspects of their lives.
