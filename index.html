<p>I am currently a first year MA student and graduate teaching assistant at Auburn University studying English with a concentration in Rhetoric and Composition.  This portfolio is a reflection of my own teaching methodologies, and will probably greatly change over the next few years as I gain more experience in the field of education.  Many of my interests revolve around the idea of transfer skills as well process and socio-expressivist practices in the classroom. However, I am also interested in linguistics and language acquisition, interactive media, and environmental studies.  The most important thing for me as a teacher is that my students view what they are doing in the classroom as something that is relevant to their overall lives, something that allows them to use analysis and inquiry to see things in a new light, and most importantly, in the end, helps them to grow.</p>
