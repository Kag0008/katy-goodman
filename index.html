<p>English, and the study of it, has profoundly changed my life.  To me it embodies humanity, emotion, psychology, history, life, reading, writing, music, communication, rhetoric, linguistics, culture, and more. I am an English major because I am fascinated by humanity, life, and love, by how people think and feel, what makes them feel that way, and how they express themselves.  I find it absolutely enthralling that so much can be found in a single subject– it is seemingly limitless in its subjective nature.  And it is in the very nature of English’s subjectivity to teach skills that are used both inside and outside of the classroom, creating an open-mindedness in the students that questions, analyzes, and critically examines both themselves and their relationship the world around them.  I use the flexibility and relevance of English as a learning tool for my students and I encourage the idea of transfer in the classroom, where both writing, inquiry, analysis, rhetoric, and communication can be seen as tools that can be utilized in not only the classroom, but also my student's daily lives.</p>


<p>I am currently a first year MA student and graduate teaching assistant at Auburn University studying English with a concentration in Rhetoric and Composition.  This portfolio is a reflection of my own teaching methodologies, and will probably greatly change over the next few years as I gain more experience in the field of education.  Many of my interests revolve around the idea of transfer skills as well process and socio-expressivist practices in the classroom. However, I am also interested in linguistics and language acquisition, interactive media, and environmental studies.  The most important thing for me as a teacher is that my students view what they are doing in the classroom as something that is relevant to their overall lives, something that allows them to use analysis and inquiry to see things in a new light, and most importantly, in the end, helps them to grow.</p>
