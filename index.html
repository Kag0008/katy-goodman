<p>I am currently a first year MA student and graduate teaching assistant at Auburn University studying Rhetoric and Composition with a concentration in Communication. This portfolio is a reflection of my own writihg and teaching methodologies; it will change over the next few years as I gain more experience in the field of writing and education.Many of my interests revolve around the idea of digital media and literacy; however, I am also interested in linguistics, interactive media, and environmental studies and sustainability. The most important thing for me as a teacher is that my students view what they are doing in the classroom as something that is relevant to their overall lives, something that allows them to use analysis and inquiry to see things in a new light, and most importantly, something that helps them to grow in a world of increasing technology.</p>
