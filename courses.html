<p>ENGL 1100 is the first element in a two course sequence devised to  introduce you to the world of colligate writing.  This course will be divided into four cohesive units, each having its own corresponding essay.  The units are designed to help you develop the skills to create and maintain effective arguments and prose while learning the rhetorical elements inherent at the college level. Within the context of the course, we will be learning how to explore the world in a critical, rhetorical, and analytical lens by examining texts, music, pop-culture, and media in hopes to both inquire and understand the world we live and interact in.</p>
